## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

 The challenge was for me to test my knowledge in HTML5 and CSS3, in which I used Flexbox. I didn't have much knowledge about css, which made me research and read a lot about it, with the help of people in the community, I managed to learn a lot about css and flexbox, how to put things in the right places and the right way.


### Continued development

I want to improove my skills on HTML and CSS and start learning more about JS
